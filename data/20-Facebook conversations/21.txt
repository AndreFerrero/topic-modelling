U1: hi how are you, just to update you we have arrived to London 
Our flight was long but we enjoyed it since we booked in the business sets any way we arrived to our hotel it is a mazing and I really like the place and arounds arear my friends. The hotel is wonderful, the staff very friendly in a cozy way, you feel at home even though its a big hotel. Room service late at night was tasty and well do e. The location is also perfect. Truly we should back alone soon before the winter, I miss you and I want your help to delay by flight back do you know any good website or booking flight application 
We couldnâ€™t fix it from the phone unfortunately, waiting for your reply and have a good day talk to you soon bye  bye
