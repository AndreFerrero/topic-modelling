U1: I want to book a flight to Dubai but I’m confuse which flight booking app is good and I’m confused between Expedia and Kayak travel applications, I know you want me to check by my self and I did but want your opinion please so I found this about my travel booking application,   
People say about Expedia application it is cheap offers some awesomely priced packages for your next trip and offers up tons of options so I  can book a flight, hotel, vacation rental, car, cruise, or local excursion all in one place. And most important for me that Expedia application has a special rewards program with three membership tiers so it provides offers and discounts on flight and hotel bookings. But things make me confused to use that it does not lets me organize all the details of each trip within the app, and hard to find good non stop flight since it a busy travel application. Please my friend let me know which one you tried before and you recommend to me and if you know other good and cheap travel applications let me know soon please before next weekend
