U1: are you fine I tried to call you but your phone was close 

U2: my sweetheart I’m writing to you while I’m spending an amazing time in Johannesburg
In Africa, we spent three days and two nights in the Thornybush Reserve, which is a small private game reserve adjacent to Kruger Park in the northeastern region of South Africa. Our guide introduced us to a bevy of animals from the moment we landed; we were greeted by a warthog at the airport, and on our first game drive we saw three of the Big Five! There is something incredibly special about the bush and witnessing dozens of majestic animals roaming free in their natural habitat. Thornybush is known for its Big Five viewing, and twice-daily game drives are available in the morning and evening. I was also impressed with the trackers and rangers, who skillfully navigate the bush without any directions or signs. The only traffic jam we encountered was a herd of elephants blocking the road, which was a nice change from the gridlocked congestion I’m used to back home. On our final night we were treated to a beautiful outdoor dinner in the bush, and we stopped on the way back to the lodge to do some stargazing. I have never seen so many stars in my life – it was truly an unforgettable experience that drove home just how small we really are. The day we departed, the entire staff came to send us off, which is just the kind of heartwarming gesture I learned to expect from the South Africans. Just want to update you and see you soon :
