U1: hi how are you? Next week is my birthday and I want to do my birthday in a small and quite restaurant what do you suggest please?

U2: happy birthday and I know some places and  if you are looking for good pub fare this is the place most I like is the one near my sisterâ€™s house, it is a new classy restaurant that located in downtown near a big park so we can go to walk after if everyone want. I went to the restaurant last day with my family and in general their food is very awesome and service also was great I like the atmosphere and I would absolutely recommend this as a place to hang out and watch the game/fight with friends. It's got plenty of room, great staff, and a ton of tv shows. The vibe here is super casual and fun. So from my experience I suggest it to you also waitresses all know me and my group of friends by this point so we always get great service. Let me know so I can call and make a reservation ok
