U1: Hello my mother how are you yesterday I decided to do salad
It was really hard for me to follow your instruction to cook pasta and honestly doing salad is easy but if I ask you to teach me how to do my grandmother salad you will make it hard also, talk to you later I want to go out with my friends to a new restaurant that opened few days ago everyone are talking about it it’s a new Lebanese restaurant and you know I like their food in general and we should go to eat in this Lebanese restaurant when you come to visit me     


U2: ok I’m glad that you couldn’t make to make sure I’m the best cooker in my family
Just jacking and sure we can go to this new Lebanese restaurants I like their food also and enjoy your time with your friend and if you see Leana please ask her to teach you how to cook I know she is good in this my dear and do not take it personal or mad at me but I want you to safe your money that you spend daily on restaurants and start to cook and eat a good and healthy food that you cook by your self  not from random people ok love
