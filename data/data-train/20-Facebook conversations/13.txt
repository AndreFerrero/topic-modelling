U1:  I want to ask you about your study, It has a lot of mathematics? Business or engineering , honestly I do not know if I can love it but it just in the University of Ottawa? I like Science and Art and my mother want me to study science or art but all have math courses 
I guess I will apply in Art program then but please tell me about your program maybe I will register in it maybe 


U2: hi believe me you will study math in all programs at the University of Ottawa and it is good for your future any way I am register in the systems science program  that provides qualified students with the opportunity for master's-level study in a broad range of areas that emphasize transdisciplinary work in the context of general systems analysis. The emphasis in Systems Science is on the development of analytical and integration skills for use in the resolution of complex applied problems that require a broad-based perspective. Also The graduate program in System Science is an interdisciplinary program specially designed for those who are interested in the analysis and modelling (mathematical and computer) of natural and man-made systems. It provides the professional with skills and knowledge required to understand, control, predict and optimize behaviour in a variety of fields from engineering and computer science to management and applied economics. The program is supervised by a Committee composed of representatives from the Department of Economics, the School of Information Technology and Engineering, the Telfer School of Management, and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
So you can see its basic math and yes it is good for you to register in art program if you want to be away from math and donâ€™t deal with programming language and hard study cases but im here if you need any more advice or help ok then
